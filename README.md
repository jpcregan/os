# os

An operating system for the IBM PC written in machine code.

## Requirements

- [hex](https://github.com/jpcregan/hex)

## Instructions

    $ ./build.sh

Run `os.img` on an IBM Compatible PC or emulator. [86Box](https://86box.net/) is recommended.

### NOTE:

The image is built for a 5.25" 160KB floppy disk. Trying to run this on a PC that expects a 3.5" disk will result in invalid sector alignment. This can be solved by converting the file to 3.5" alignment, or changing the floppy emulation on your PC. Configurable file format will be added to the build system at a later date.

## Features

- Loads kernel from disk
- Basic input and output routines

### TODO:

- Implement basic shell
